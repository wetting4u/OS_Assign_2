# Page Replacement Algorithms Performance Analysis Report

## 1. Introduction

Page replacement is a fundamental problem in virtual memory management systems. When physical memory is insufficient to hold all pages required by running processes, the operating system must decide which pages to evict from memory to make room for new pages. This decision significantly impacts system performance, as page faults require expensive disk I/O operations.

This study investigates the performance characteristics of three page replacement algorithms: Least Recently Used (LRU), Clock (Second Chance), and Random replacement. We analyze their behavior across four different memory trace files (bzip, swim, gcc, and sixpack) under varying memory constraints to understand which algorithm performs best in different scenarios.

The key research questions addressed are:
- How much memory does each traced program actually need for optimal performance?
- Which page replacement algorithm works best when memory is severely constrained?
- Does one algorithm consistently outperform others across all workloads?
- What are the trade-offs between algorithmic complexity and performance gains?

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Experimental Setup

We implemented and tested three page replacement algorithms:

1. **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Replaces the page that has been unused for the longest time. Maintains access time information for all pages.

2. **Clock (Second Chance)**: A circular buffer implementation that gives recently accessed pages a "second chance" before replacement. Uses reference bits to track recent access.

3. **Random**: Selects a victim page randomly from all loaded pages. Serves as a baseline for comparison.

### 2.2 Test Workloads

Four memory trace files were analyzed, each containing 1,000,000 memory access operations:

- **bzip.trace**: Compression algorithm with good locality
- **swim.trace**: Computational fluid dynamics simulation  
- **gcc.trace**: Compiler with moderate memory usage patterns
- **sixpack.trace**: Image processing application

### 2.3 Experimental Design

To systematically explore the performance space, we tested different memory configurations:

1. **Excess memory scenarios**: Frames significantly above each program's requirements
   - BZIP: 500+ frames (vs 317 needed)
   - SWIM: 3000+ frames (vs 2543 needed)  
   - GCC/SIXPACK: 5000+ frames (vs ~3000-4000 needed)

2. **Memory shortage scenarios**: Severely constrained memory (10-100 frames)
   - Tests algorithm behavior under extreme pressure
   - Reveals performance differences when thrashing occurs

3. **Near-optimal scenarios**: Frame counts close to actual program requirements
   - BZIP: 200-500 frames around the 317 needed
   - SWIM: 1000-3000 frames around the 2543 needed
   - GCC/SIXPACK: 2000-4000 frames around their requirements

For each trace and algorithm combination, we measured:
- Page fault rate (page faults / total memory accesses)
- Total disk reads (page faults requiring disk access)
- Total disk writes (dirty page evictions requiring write-back)
- Total I/O operations (reads + writes)

### 2.4 Data Collection

A total of 102 experiments were conducted, systematically varying:
- 4 trace files × 3 algorithms × 8-9 frame counts per trace

Results were automatically collected and analyzed using Python scripts to ensure consistency and reproducibility.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Memory Requirements Analysis

Analysis of the trace files revealed each program's actual memory footprint:

| Program | Unique Pages | Total Memory Footprint | Working Set (High Memory) |
|---------|--------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| BZIP    | 317          | 1.2 MB                 | ~300 pages (~1.2 MB)     |
| SWIM    | 2,543        | 9.9 MB                 | ~2,500 pages (~10 MB)    |
| GCC     | 2,852        | 11.1 MB                | ~2,900 pages (~11.6 MB)  |
| SIXPACK | 3,890        | 15.2 MB                | ~3,900 pages (~15.6 MB)  |

The **unique pages** represent the total number of distinct memory pages accessed throughout program execution, while the **working set** indicates the minimum memory needed for optimal performance based on our high-memory experiments.
